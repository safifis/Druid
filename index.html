                    <strong>Contributions:</strong> All the authors have equal
                    contributions. The listing order is random. All authors
                    participated in brainstorming, project designing, coding,
                    and writing. The main responsibilities of each person are
                    written below: Zhening proposed the idea (hence Zheing is
                    the owner of this Kaggle notebook), organized the meeting,
                    and wrote R codes for interactive plots in Introduction and
                    Step 2. Pu carried out the best subset regression in Step 1,
                    designed some interactive plots in Step 3, and wrote the
                    Discussion and Conclusion. Nemo constructed our dataset by
                    filtering the FIFA dataset, studied pace vs npxG_diff in
                    Step 3, and contributed all the writing parts of this
                    report.

                <h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    In recent years, expected goals (xG) has become a common
                    feature for media and mainstream broadcasters in the soccer
                    industry. Introduced by Opta's Sam Green in 2012, xG has
                    been created to estimate the quality of every scoring chance
                    in a game. Although xG was initially used to measure the
                    quality of every shot's chance, it soon evolved into a
                    soccer analysis tool to measure players' performance,
                    especially for attackers. In this report, a new measurement,
                    Expected Goals Difference (xG_diff), is defined as the
                    difference between the player's goals and xG to evaluate an
                    attacking player’s skill. A positive xG_diff indicates the
                    player scores more goals than the xG model expects; While a
                    negative xG_diff indicates the player scores fewer goals
                    than the xG model expects.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, the vlogger Tifo IRL analyzed the player’s
                    ability based on a non-penalty goal vs. non-penalty
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWQf87FMEqo"
                        >xG scatter plot</a
                    >. It makes intuitive sense that a positive correlation
                    exists between xG and a player’s shooting ability for most
                    readers. Scientifically, however, it is untested.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The two plots displayed above depict the relationship
                    between xG_diff and two features: shooting and Whoscored
                    rating. Neither of the plots demonstrates a notable trend
                    suggesting a correlation between xG_diff and either shooting
                    or Whoscored rating. It raised doubts regarding the
                    reliability and accuracy of xG_diff as a metric to evaluate
                    a player’s shooting ability or overall performance. Hence,
                    the report aims to conduct a thorough investigation on
                    xG_diff and address the question
                    <b>“Does a higher xG_diff indicate a better player?”</b>
